change loss term to

 !     loss term for mg+ and fe+ (from mcneil et al. (2001) - fig 2)

  if ( alts(i,nfl,nll) < 100. ) then
    xloss_110  = 1.e-13
    delx_loss  = .6
    xloss_rate = xloss_110 * exp(-(alts(i,nfl,nll)-100.)/delx_loss)
    loss(i,ptmgp)  = xloss_rate
    loss(i,ptfep)  = xloss_rate
